## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

I'm familiar with many different languages, including Java (where I enjoy learning more about bytecode and the internals of the JVM), C++, PHP, and Python, though the majority of my knowledge and experience centers around Java. I've also worked with various technologies, including Maven, Git, MySQL, Redis, and have worked with CentOS and Ubuntu.
